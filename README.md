Notes:
- Kilon Ailos has awesome tutorials on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJMkk_HLknuhO6kk6LLBHcg
  That's where I learned how to export code for github.

- There's some extra metadata that Monticello exports w/ the code that
  is as far as I understand, Pharo's own code change management...have
  not spent any time figuring out if this can just work seamlessly w/
  git or other VC systems.

- I am trying hard to resist the urge to freak out that code is in a
  repo not exactly as I typed it but with additional metadata...that's
  the future right? Worrying about file purity is crazy when you have
  awesome tools right???
